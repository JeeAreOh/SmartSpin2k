# [SmartSpin2K Hardware]
V3 is the brand spanking new version where we've gone to a more rigid mount and designed a completly custom PCB with SMT components which can be manufactured using automated techniques. THe newest PCB sports a uart->serial driver to allow direct communication with Peloton bikes. 

V2 prints easier, is smaller and uses less hardware. It has a much better gear ratio than V1 and supports a carrier board PCB onto which the devkits mount for easy wiring/soldering.  A rigid mount referred to as Direct Mount is available for stable mounting.

V1 is the oldest printable version. It's slightly more sophisticated than duct tape and cardboard. The common assets do not work with this version, the V1 folder includes knob cups and adaptors specific to V1. You'll probably only use this directory if you need to print replacement parts for a V1.

Hardware is available in two primary versions.  V2 - The Through-Hole soldered version, can easily be DIY'ed by anyone with basic soldering and electronics experience.  V3 - Integrated PCB is new and uses a manufactured PCB with a serial interface specifically designed for integration with Peloton bikes.  

There's additional information in each folder to help you determine what parts might work best for you. 

# [Directory]
## [V2 - Through-Hole Soldered](https://github.com/doudar/SmartSpin2k/tree/develop/Hardware/V2%20-%20Through%20Hole)
Available in many case versions.  The direct mount mod is the recommended solution for new builders and DIYers.  It is supported on various bikes and is easily adapted to other form factors.  

## [V3 - Integrated PCB](https://github.com/doudar/SmartSpin2k/tree/develop/Hardware/V3%20-%20Integrated%20PCB)
Use with the SMT manufaactured PCB and for compatibility with Peloton bikes.

## [Common Assets](https://github.com/doudar/SmartSpin2k/tree/develop/Hardware/Common%20Assets)
### [Arm](https://github.com/doudar/SmartSpin2k/tree/develop/Hardware/Common%20Assets/Arm)
The Arm is used to connect the SmartSpin2K to the bike mount.  See Readme for sizing and fitment information.

Required for V3 and V2 Direct Mount.

### [Bike Mount](https://github.com/doudar/SmartSpin2k/tree/develop/Hardware/Common%20Assets/Bike%20Mount)
Attaches to the head tube of your bike and provides an attachment point for the arm.

Required for V3 and V2 Direct Mount

### [Gears](https://github.com/doudar/SmartSpin2k/tree/develop/Hardware/Common%20Assets/Bike%20Mount)
Internal drive gears for the SmartSpin2K.  11:40t gearing.

Required for all V2 and V3 variations

### [Inserts](https://github.com/doudar/SmartSpin2k/tree/develop/Hardware/Common%20Assets/Inserts)
Choose the appropriate insert for your bike.  There are some generic knob designs that apply to several no-name models.  Browse the directory - your bike may already be covered.

Required for all V2 and V3 variations
 

### [KnobCup](https://github.com/doudar/SmartSpin2k/tree/develop/Hardware/Common%20Assets/KnobCups)
Knob Cup retains the insert and connects to the internal gearbox of the SmartSpin2K

Required for all V2 and V3 variations

### [Shifters](https://github.com/doudar/SmartSpin2k/tree/develop/Hardware/Common%20Assets/Shifters)
You'll want shifters to do sim rides with.  Print this in TPU.
