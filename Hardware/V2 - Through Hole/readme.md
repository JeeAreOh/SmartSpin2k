- Long case is suitable for bikes with a minimum of 115mm of space between the center of the knob and the head tube such as the Bowflex C6, Peloton Bike, and Echelon Connect Sport.  The shortest arm tested by the dev team is suitable for bikes with 130-150mm of clearance
- Short Case is suitable for bikes with minimum clearance of approximately 81mm - such as the Bowflex C7.  

## [Universal Mount]
- Suitable for use across numerous bikes or simply if a direct mount solution is not required in your situation.
- Minimum clearance of 49mm between the center of knob and the rear of the head tube (side closest to the cyclist)  is required

## [Ultra Short Mod]
- This is a version of Case V2 that's been shortened to allow use on bikes with less than 49mm head tube spacing.
