Hardware for use with the R3 PCB. 

# Revision 3

Introduces the newest PCB with a serial interface specifically designed for integration with Peloton bikes and provides a path for DIY'ers to order a board and cable kit that doesn't require any soldering skills. It's "print", "plug" and "play".  

The case is suitable for bikes with a minimum of 80mm of space between the center of the knob and the head tube.  It has been tested on the Peloton Bike and clearance for fit is confirmed on Bowflex C6, Echelon Connect Sport, and Peloton Bike.
